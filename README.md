# Dog breed classifier using PyTorch

This project is about creating a classifier to recognize different dog breeds from dog images. First, it includes classifiers to recognize humans and dogs from images. Second, there is an attempt to create a classifier from scratch to recognize dog breeds. Finally, there is a classifier which uses a pretrained model based on one of the famous architectures for image classification tasks, deep neural network ResNet-18.
